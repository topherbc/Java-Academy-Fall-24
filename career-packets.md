# Professional Development - Career Packets

- These packets are to be used as direction, and/or suggestions on how to continue forward into a particular path. These are in no way the extensive, end-all be-all for each direction. Only as a helpful guide to get started. 



## Publishing studio

  * Here are a few recommendations on what to do to get started
  * First, have a book to publish
  * Market this book, using social media, web presence, and even word of mouth. Each of these topics are easily searchable on how to get started in marketing, other options include following existing companies and watching how they market and use that as a framework
  * Companies like https://www.bookbaby.com/book-printing can help with printing, and it’s much easier to get started and market with a smaller release. At least to help drive demand in the beginning
  * Start an LLC, lots of sites like this could help https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-start-an-llc-in-7-steps
  * Books can have an enormous range, it can be important to have a brand and establish a certain type of release. It could also be helpful just to release a lot of different items. This could be done through e-books as well. https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Create/b?node=18292298011
